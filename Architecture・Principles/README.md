# Architechture/Principles

## What is roots of Internet?
Internet roots is the ARPANet which connect big academic computers together.

## What is ARPANet?
ARPANet was published in 1966
The first operational ARPANet Node came online in 1969 at UCLA, SRI, UCSB,Utah, 
Around the same time, The national physical Laboratory in the UK also came online.
By 1971, There ware about 20 ARPANet Nodes.
ARAPNet is the first host to host protocol.
There were cross country links, and all the links were at 50KBPS.
In June 1974, ARPANet was connected to MPLNet.
But of cource, ARPANet wasn't the only network in that time. For instance, Sat Net operated over satellite, packet radio networks and Ethernet local area network.

## Protocol chenged
Work started in 1973on replacing the original network control protocol with TCP/IP.
â€»IP was the Internetwork Protocol and TCP was the Transmission Control Protocol.
TCP/IP was ultimately standardized from 1978 to 1981 and inclouded in Bekley UNIX in 1981.
on January 1st, 1983 the internet had the one of its flag days, where the ARPANet transitioned to TCP/IP.
In 1982, The internet saw the rollout of the domain name system which replaced the host.text file containing all the world's machine names with a distributed name lookup system.
1988 saw the rollout of TCP congestion controll after the next suffered a series of congestion collapses.
1989 saw the NSF net and BGP inter-domain routing. Including support for routing policy.
the 90s saw a lot of new applications. In approximately 1992, we started to see a lot of streaming media, including audio and video.
The web not soon after, in 1993, which allowed users to browse a mesh of hyperlinks.
The first major search engine was Altavista, which cane online in December of 1995, and peer to peer protocols and applications including file sharing, negan to emerge around 2000.

## Internet Problems and Growing Pains
One of the major problem is that we're running out of addresses.
The current version of the internet protocol, IPV4, uses 32-bit addresses.
So that the IPV4 internet only has 2 to the 32 IP addresses, Or about 4 billion IP addresses, Furthermore, these IP addresses need to be.
Allocated hierarchy and many portions of the IP address space are not allocated very effciently. Fro example, MIT has one two fifth sixth of all the internet address space. 

Another problem is congestion control.
congestion control's goal is to match offered load to available capacity. But one of the problems with today's congestion control algorithms is that they have insufficient dynamic range.
They don't work very well over slow and flaky wireless links and they don't work very well over very high speed. Intercontinental paths.
A third major problem is routing. Routing is the process by which those on the internet discover paths to take to reach another destination.
Today's internet routing protocol, BGP, suffers a number of ills, including a lack of security, ease of misconfiguration, poor convergence, and non-determinism.
But it is sort of works and it's the most critical piece of the internet infrastructure in some sense because it's the glue that holds all of the internet service provaiders together.
Another major problem in today's internet is security. Now while we're reasonably good at encryption and authentication, we are not actually so good at turning these mechanisms on.
The fifthe major problem is denial of service and the internet does a very good job of transmitting packets to a destination.  
Even if the destination doesn't want those packets, This makes it easy for attacker to overload servers or network links to prevent the victim from donig useful work.
Distributed denial of service attackes are particularly commonplace on today's internet.
